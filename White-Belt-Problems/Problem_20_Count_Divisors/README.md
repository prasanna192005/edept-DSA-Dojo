# Problem 20: Count Divisors

## Problem Statement
Given an integer `N`, count the number of its positive divisors.

## Input
A single integer `N`.

## Output
The number of positive divisors of `N`.

## Example
**Input:**
```
6
```

**Output:**
```
4
```

## Constraints
1 <= N <= 1,000,000

## Explanation
A number is a divisor if it divides `N` without a remainder. Check each number from 1 to N, or optimize by checking up to the square root.
