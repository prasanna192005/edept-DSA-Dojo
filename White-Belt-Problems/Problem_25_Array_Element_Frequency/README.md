# Problem 25: Array Element Frequency

## Problem Statement
Given an array of `N` integers, find the frequency of a given number `X`.

## Input
The first line contains `N` and `X`. The second line contains `N` space-separated integers.

## Output
The number of times `X` appears in the array.

## Example
**Input:**
```
5 3
1 3 2 3 4
```

**Output:**
```
2
```

## Constraints
1 <= N <= 1000, -10^6 <= X, array elements <= 10^6

## Explanation
Iterate through the array and count occurrences of `X`.
