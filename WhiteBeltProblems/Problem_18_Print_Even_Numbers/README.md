# Problem 18: Print Even Numbers

## Problem Statement
Given `N`, print all even numbers from 2 to `N` in a single line, space-separated.

## Input
A single integer `N`.

## Output
All even numbers from 2 to `N`, space-separated.

## Example
**Input:**
```
10
```

**Output:**
```
2 4 6 8 10
```

## Constraints
2 <= N <= 1000

## Explanation
Use a loop to iterate from 2 to N with a step of 2, or check each number with modulo to identify evens.
