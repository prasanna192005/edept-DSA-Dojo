# Problem 14: Factorial Iterative

## Problem Statement
Calculate the factorial of a number `N` (N!).

## Input
A single integer `N`.

## Output
The factorial of `N`.

## Example
**Input:**
```
5
```

**Output:**
```
120
```

## Constraints
0 <= N <= 20

## Explanation
Initialize a result variable to 1. Loop from 1 to N, multiplying the result by the loop counter in each step. Factorial of 0 is 1.
